1. Introduction & Literature Review1.1 IntroductionMobile apps for home service are becoming more popular, but most of them are focused on pre-scheduled maintenance rather than emergency repairs. QuickFix takes its place by providing a platform that addresses the issue of emergency home repairs by connecting users with local technicians in real time while providing intelligent chatbot support for enhanced user experience. The app is designed to make users’ lives easier by eliminating the waiting times that typically accompany repair scheduling and providing 24/7 assistance through an AI powered chatbot. It ensures that users with emergencies like leaking pipes or electrical problems can get help without any delay and receive instant support through the integrated chatbot system.The major technologies used in QuickFix- Flutter, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python based chatbot have been selected carefully to ensure a seamless and efficient app. Flutter offers a smooth mobile experience on Android devices, while Node.js and Express allow fast processing of user requests. MongoDB, a flexible schema NoSQL database, is the ideal choice for managing various types of data such as user profiles, technician data, real time service requests, and chatbot conversation logs. The Python based chatbot provides intelligent assistance for booking, troubleshooting, and customer support. The project aligns with recent trends where speed, reliability, intelligent assistance, and end-user confidence are pivotal to success.1.2 Background and MotivationExisting home repair apps take a long time to respond and often lack immediate support, which is demotivating for customers who are faced with emergencies. Home repairs need to be done as quickly as possible to prevent further damage or injury, and users often need immediate guidance and support during stressful situations. This indicates the urgent necessity of an app like QuickFix, where customers can immediately contact experts based on location and availability while receiving instant support through an intelligent chatbot assistant.The driving force behind the project is the realization that a significant amount of this kind of service request is emergency based and requires immediate assistance and guidance. The success of other platforms like Uber, based on real-time matching, combined with the growing demand for AI-powered customer support, is the underlying mechanic behind QuickFix. Adapting the same methods but for domestic repair with added intelligent chatbot functionality, QuickFix aims to bring reliability, instant help, and 24/7 support to the home repair business.1.3 Problem in briefThe main problem QuickFix addresses is the lack of immediate access to home repair services during emergencies. Current apps provide mostly pre scheduled services, which result in stress and potential damage in situations of needed emergency repairs. Users need a way to obtain immediate, reliable, available technicians without having to wait for days.QuickFix solves this by solely focusing on real time matching and availability via real time location monitoring, adding a chatbot, and live technician availability updates. This ensures timely management of emergencies, reducing damage, cost, and stress for users in need of immediate assistance.1.4 Aim & Objectives1.4.1 AimThe aim of this project is to develop a real-time home repair service platform that provides immediate access to available technicians through live location tracking, smart matching, and chatbot assistance using Flutter, Node.js, MongoDB, and Google Maps API.1.4.2 Objectives* Critically review the problem domain of emergency home repair service access, identifying key user pain points and existing solution gaps by 2025/03/27.* Conduct a critical study of selected technologies, including Flutter, Node.js, MongoDB, Google Maps API, and chatbot frameworks, to assess their suitability and integration feasibility by 2025/04/07.* Design and develop a real-time technician tracking and trusted service booking system utilizing the chosen technologies, with functional user authentication, smart matching, live location tracking, and chatbot assistance by 2025/08/08.* Evaluate the system’s performance, usability, and reliability through testing, debugging, and user feedback collection by 2025/10/03.* Prepare and submit comprehensive final documentation, including technical reports, user manuals, and deployment guides, by 2025/11/25.1.5 Scope Scope of the Proposed SolutionThe scope of QuickFix encompasses the development of a comprehensive, real-time home repair service platform that connects users with available technicians instantly during emergencies.

the study is grounded in the context of multi-sided platforms, which are businesses that facilitate interactions between two or more interdependent groups, usually consumers and producers, and which have become increasingly prevalent with the growth of the internet, mobile technologies, and network effects; the author begins by explaining that while there is a rich body of literature on traditional business models, the unique characteristics of platform-based models such as indirect network effects, scalability, and the co-creation of value require adapted frameworks to properly analyse them; this work therefore seeks to fill that gap by combining established theoretical concepts, such as Osterwalder and Pigneur’s business model canvas, with newer ideas from platform economics and innovation theory; the research adopts a qualitative case study methodology, focusing on a leading digital platform company, in order to gather nuanced insights through interviews, document analysis, and observation, with data triangulation used to ensure validity; the background review traces the evolution of business model research, from its early usage as a buzzword in the 1990s during the dot-com boom, to more rigorous definitions and frameworks in the 2000s, highlighting how the literature has often focused on single-sided businesses, leaving multi-sided platforms less well understood; the theoretical framework in this thesis integrates elements from business model theory, platform economics, and strategic management, identifying key components such as value proposition, key activities, partners, customer segments, revenue streams, and cost structure, but adapting them to reflect the unique role of network effects, user acquisition strategies, and governance mechanisms in platforms; the research questions revolve around how the studied platform designs its value proposition to attract and retain different user groups, how it balances the interests of these groups, what capabilities and resources underpin its competitive advantage, and how it responds to environmental changes; the methodology section explains why a single case study approach was chosen to allow deep exploration of complex, context-dependent processes and describes the selection criteria for the case, the process of gaining access to company data and participants, and the steps taken to code and analyse the data; the case study subject is a well-known global platform that connects service providers with consumers through a digital interface, relying on technology infrastructure, algorithms, and a critical mass of users to generate value; the findings reveal that the platform’s success hinges on three interrelated factors: (1) a compelling, multi-layered value proposition that appeals to both consumers (convenience, variety, trust) and providers (market access, payment security, analytics), (2) the ability to leverage data analytics and machine learning to personalise offerings and optimise matching, and (3) strong governance rules that manage quality, resolve disputes, and maintain trust across the ecosystem; the study also finds that user acquisition strategies such as referral programs, targeted marketing, and partnerships are critical in the early stages, while in later stages, retaining users through loyalty programs, service quality, and continuous innovation becomes more important; network effects are shown to create a virtuous cycle, but they can also lead to winner-takes-all dynamics, making it essential for platforms to maintain their lead through innovation and ecosystem expansion; the analysis further highlights the role of adaptability and strategic agility, with the platform frequently experimenting with new features, expanding into adjacent markets, and adjusting its policies in response to regulatory pressures and competitive threats; in terms of organisational capabilities, the company exhibits strong digital capabilities, an agile development process, and a culture that encourages experimentation and data-driven decision making; partnerships play a key role, with the platform integrating third-party services to enhance its offering and sharing data with partners to co-create value; the research also considers the risks and challenges faced by platforms, such as disintermediation (users bypassing the platform), the potential for negative network effects (where too many low-quality participants reduce value), and the need to navigate complex regulatory landscapes; the discussion section interprets these findings in light of existing theory, confirming some established ideas such as the importance of critical mass and extending others, for example by showing how platforms actively shape their ecosystems rather than passively benefiting from network effects; it is argued that successful platforms need to adopt a holistic approach that aligns their technological, organisational, and relational resources, and that they must continuously evolve their business models to respond to external changes; the conclusion summarises the main contributions of the study: providing a richer, empirically grounded understanding of how digital platforms create and capture value, offering a refined business model framework tailored to platforms, and identifying strategic practices that can guide both managers and policymakers; the thesis also acknowledges its limitations, such as the focus on a single case, which may limit generalisability, and suggests avenues for future research, including comparative studies across different types of platforms, longitudinal research on platform evolution, and investigations into the societal impacts of platform dominance; overall, the work underscores that in the digital economy, platform-based business models represent a distinct and increasingly important organisational form, one that demands specific strategies, capabilities, and governance structures to succeed, and that understanding these is vital not only for academic theory but also for practical management and policy-making. (Anon., 2024)  										2024Mobile Application Marketplaces - an Investigation from Customers' PerspectiveThe study explores the emergence and development of mobile application marketplaces from the viewpoint of customers, focusing on their influence on mobile device choice, perceived value, and long-term engagement, explaining that in recent years app stores have become a decisive factor in the competitiveness of mobile devices, similar to the way software ecosystems shaped the PC market, with companies like Apple and Google using them to lock customers into their platforms, and this has transformed the value chain by enabling direct consumer-to-consumer interactions for digital goods, fostering active user participation, and creating new business strategies for distributing information products; the paper notes that in 2008 US consumers, for the first time, spent more on applications than on the devices themselves, a sign of the shifting value from hardware to software and services, and that some manufacturers, such as Apple with the iPhone, restrict installation to apps from their own marketplace, thereby binding customers to their ecosystem, leading the researchers to investigate how important the existence and diversity of an app marketplace is when people choose a device, what kinds of applications and features they value most, and what criteria they use to evaluate a marketplace; the authors review related work on software ecosystems, electronic marketplaces, and consumer behaviour in digital goods markets, noting that the value proposition of a mobile application marketplace involves aspects such as app variety, ease of purchase, trust, usability, and pricing models, and that network effects play a key role because the more users and developers a platform attracts, the more valuable it becomes for each group; they describe their research method, which combined surveys and interviews to gather data from mobile device users with different levels of experience, using structured questionnaires to collect demographic data, device preferences, app usage patterns, and marketplace perceptions, and interviews to gain deeper insights into motivations and expectations; the findings indicate that customers see application marketplaces as integral to their mobile experience, with the majority stating that the availability of desired apps influences their choice of device as much as, or more than, hardware specifications, and that app diversity, quality, and ease of search were ranked as the top marketplace attributes, while factors like payment convenience, security, and clear categorisation also contributed to positive perceptions; the analysis reveals distinct user segments, such as heavy app users who frequently explore and purchase apps and place high value on new releases and recommendations, versus casual users who mostly download free, well-known apps and are less engaged with the broader marketplace ecosystem; pricing strategies were found to be important, with many customers preferring free apps or those under a low-cost threshold, though some were willing to pay more for apps that deliver clear value or unique functions, and in-app advertising was generally accepted if it allowed apps to be offered free; trust emerged as a critical factor, with users favouring marketplaces that vet apps for quality and security, provide clear developer information, and handle payment securely, and marketplaces perceived as unsafe or cluttered with low-quality apps were less attractive even if they had large numbers of offerings; usability also played a role, with marketplaces that offered intuitive navigation, effective search, and personalised recommendations being rated higher, and customers responded positively to features like user reviews, ratings, and screenshots that help them make informed decisions; the study notes that platform lock-in can be both a benefit and a drawback for customers on the one hand it creates a stable, familiar environment with reliable quality standards, but on the other hand it limits choice and prevents using apps from outside sources, with attitudes toward this varying depending on how much value users place on freedom versus security and integration; the researchers conclude that for mobile device makers and platform owners, cultivating a strong application marketplace is not just a complement to the device but a central element of their value proposition, and that success depends on balancing app quantity and quality, supporting developers, maintaining trust and usability, and fostering network effects to sustain long-term engagement; the paper suggests that future research could explore cross-platform comparisons, the role of emerging technologies like augmented reality in app marketplaces, and the implications of regulatory changes on marketplace operations, but emphasises that already, from the customers’ perspective, the marketplace is as important as the device itself in shaping satisfaction, loyalty, and purchasing decisions.

Academic performance here refers to the measurable results of a student’s learning, often represented through grades, GPA, or other evaluation scores. In Vietnam, higher education has been undergoing significant transformation in recent decades due to globalization, the demand for a skilled workforce, and the government’s push to improve quality standards to match international levels. Despite these efforts, student performance is not consistent across institutions, and many learners face challenges that affect their results. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate various influences, combining surveys, statistical analysis, and literature review to identify patterns and relationships. The research starts by examining the broader context of education in Vietnam, where rapid expansion in university enrollment has increased diversity in student backgrounds, abilities, and preparation levels. The shift from an elite to a mass education system has brought opportunities but also challenges, such as maintaining quality, addressing skill gaps, and supporting students with varied socioeconomic conditions. Vietnamese universities operate in a competitive and resource-limited environment, where both students and faculty face pressure to achieve higher outcomes. Academic success is affected by multiple interacting factors, which the study categorizes into three main groups: student-related factors, teacher-related factors, and environment-related factors. Student-related factors include personal motivation, self-discipline, study habits, time management skills, prior academic preparation, and socioeconomic background. Motivation emerges as one of the strongest predictors of performance, with students who have clear goals and a strong internal drive generally performing better. Self-discipline and effective time management allow students to balance academic demands with personal responsibilities, while poor habits such as procrastination or excessive leisure activities can lead to lower grades. Socioeconomic background influences performance through access to resources such as textbooks, computers, stable internet, and a quiet study environment. Students from wealthier families often have more support and fewer distractions, while those from disadvantaged backgrounds may need to work part-time or face financial stress, reducing their study time and concentration. Prior academic preparation also matters, as students who enter university with strong foundational knowledge in key subjects like mathematics, reading, and writing tend to adapt more quickly to the demands of higher education.Teacher-related factors are equally important. The quality of instruction, teaching methods, feedback, and teacher-student relationships all play a major role in learning outcomes. In Vietnam, as in many countries, traditional lecture-based teaching is still common, but the study notes that more interactive and student-centered approaches lead to better understanding and retention of knowledge. Teachers who encourage active participation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills tend to foster higher performance. Feedback quality is also crucial, as timely and constructive feedback helps students identify their strengths and weaknesses and take corrective action. Teacher enthusiasm and passion for the subject can inspire students, while poor communication or a lack of engagement can reduce interest and motivation. The teacher-student relationship builds trust and respect, creating an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions, seeking help, and engaging in discussions. This relationship is particularly significant in Vietnam, where cultural values emphasize respect for teachers and hierarchical roles. A supportive teaching approach can help break down barriers and encourage more open interaction.The third group of influences consists of environment-related factors, which cover the physical, institutional, and social aspects of the learning environment. Physical infrastructure such as classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and technology access affects the learning process. Well-equipped facilities enable practical learning and experimentation, which are essential for understanding complex subjects. Institutional policies, curriculum design, and administrative support also matter. Universities with clear academic policies, well-structured programs, and effective student support services create conditions for better performance. Administrative efficiency in areas like course registration, scheduling, and exam organization reduces unnecessary stress and confusion. Social factors include peer influence, group study opportunities, and campus culture. Positive peer influence can encourage good study habits, while negative influence can lead to distraction or disengagement. Group work and collaborative learning help students develop teamwork skills and learn from each other, but they also require effective management to ensure fair contribution from all members.The study’s quantitative analysis uses statistical tools to measure the strength of relationships between these factors and academic performance. Surveys were distributed to students across multiple universities, asking about their study habits, motivation levels, socioeconomic status, relationships with teachers, and perceptions of the learning environment. The data was analyzed using regression models to identify which factors had the most significant impact. Results confirmed that motivation, time management, and teacher quality were among the top predictors of academic success. Socioeconomic background also showed a strong influence, with students from higher-income families tending to achieve better results. However, the study also found that some students from disadvantaged backgrounds performed exceptionally well when they had high motivation, strong self-discipline, and supportive teachers, suggesting that individual determination and effective teaching can partially offset socioeconomic disadvantages. The findings underline the importance of holistic interventions that address not only academic content but also personal development, teacher training, and institutional support.One notable insight is that academic performance is not determined by a single factor but by the interaction of many elements. A motivated student may still underperform if teaching quality is poor or facilities are inadequate, while a student with good teachers and resources may fail to thrive without personal discipline. This means that improving academic performance requires a coordinated approach involving students, teachers, and institutions working together. For students, interventions might include workshops on study skills, time management, and self-motivation techniques. For teachers, professional development programs can help adopt modern teaching methods, improve feedback practices, and build better relationships with students. For institutions, investments in infrastructure, technology, and support services can create an environment that fosters learning. The study recommends that universities develop targeted strategies that address the specific needs of different student groups, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to succeed in a diverse student population.Cultural context also plays a role in shaping the factors that influence performance. In Vietnam, the respect for authority and emphasis on examination results can sometimes lead to rote learning, where students focus on memorizing information rather than developing critical thinking skills. The study argues for a gradual shift toward more active learning approaches that encourage questioning, creativity, and independent problem-solving. Such changes may face resistance from both students and teachers accustomed to traditional methods, but the long-term benefits for academic performance and employability are significant. The research also highlights the importance of aligning university curricula with labor market demands so that students see a clear connection between what they learn and their future careers. This connection can boost motivation and relevance, leading to better performance.The study concludes that improving academic performance in Vietnamese universities is a complex challenge that requires attention to personal, instructional, and environmental factors. By fostering motivation, self-discipline, and effective study habits in students, improving teaching quality through training and innovation, and enhancing institutional support and infrastructure, universities can create a more supportive learning ecosystem. Collaboration between the government, universities, teachers, and students is necessary to implement these changes. The findings are not only relevant to Vietnam but also offer lessons for other developing countries facing similar challenges in higher education. The research provides a foundation for future studies that could explore the long-term effects of targeted interventions and how digital technologies, globalization, and cultural shifts might further influence academic performance in the years ahead. (Anon., 2021)												2021Increasing customer service efficiency through artificial intelligence chatbotThe document focuses on the growing importance of renewable energy in the global energy transition and how geospatial analysis can play a crucial role in planning and implementing renewable energy projects. It begins by highlighting the urgency of shifting away from fossil fuels due to climate change, environmental degradation, and the depletion of non-renewable resources. The world’s energy consumption is steadily increasing, driven by industrialization, population growth, and urbanization, but the environmental consequences of conventional energy systems are becoming increasingly severe. In this context, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass are seen as key solutions for sustainable energy development. However, identifying the best sites for renewable energy infrastructure is not straightforward. Site selection for solar farms, wind turbines, or hydroelectric plants requires detailed analysis of environmental, technical, economic, and social factors to ensure efficiency, minimize costs, and reduce negative impacts. This is where geospatial analysis tools and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) come into play. By integrating spatial data with environmental and economic models, planners can make informed decisions about where and how to deploy renewable energy technologies. The paper emphasizes that geospatial tools allow decision-makers to overlay various datasets such as topography, land use, solar irradiation, wind speed, infrastructure networks, environmental constraints, and population density to identify areas with the highest potential for energy generation. For example, a GIS-based analysis can combine satellite imagery, meteorological data, and grid infrastructure maps to determine the most suitable locations for solar photovoltaic farms that maximize sunlight exposure while avoiding ecologically sensitive areas.The document describes how renewable energy planning involves a multi-criteria decision-making process, where different parameters must be balanced. In the case of wind energy, for example, planners must consider average wind speed, turbulence, proximity to transmission lines, land ownership, and potential conflicts with wildlife habitats. GIS can model wind patterns at different heights and seasons to identify areas where wind speeds are consistently high enough to generate power economically. For solar energy, GIS can evaluate daily and seasonal solar radiation levels, shading from terrain or structures, and proximity to existing infrastructure. Hydroelectric potential requires analysis of river flow rates, seasonal variations, watershed characteristics, and environmental impacts such as fish migration or changes in sediment flow. Biomass energy mapping involves locating agricultural or forestry residues, transportation networks for feedstock delivery, and conversion facility sites. Geothermal resource mapping requires integrating geological, geophysical, and geochemical data to identify underground heat reservoirs. The document stresses that spatial analysis does not just identify opportunities but also helps avoid risks by revealing environmental restrictions, social conflicts, and logistical challenges. For instance, renewable energy sites should avoid protected natural areas, densely populated regions that may resist infrastructure development, and zones prone to natural hazards such as flooding, earthquakes, or landslides.The paper also emphasizes the role of remote sensing technology in renewable energy assessment. Satellite imagery and aerial photography provide up-to-date, high-resolution information on land cover, vegetation health, and infrastructure, enabling planners to monitor changes over time and verify site suitability. Coupled with GIS, remote sensing allows large-scale assessments that would be too costly or time-consuming to conduct solely with ground surveys. The authors give examples of how remote sensing has been used to identify solar farm locations by measuring ground reflectance and cloud cover patterns, or to assess wind energy potential by analyzing vegetation displacement and landscape openness. Moreover, LiDAR technology is highlighted as valuable for creating detailed elevation models that help determine slope, aspect, and shading critical factors for both solar and wind energy projects.Another key point in the document is the integration of socio-economic factors into geospatial renewable energy planning. While natural resource availability is fundamental, the economic feasibility and social acceptability of projects also determine success. GIS tools can map population density, income levels, electricity demand, and access to existing energy infrastructure, allowing developers to target areas where renewable energy projects can have the most significant social and economic benefits. In rural electrification projects, for example, GIS can identify off-grid communities where solar microgrids or wind turbines would be most impactful. The combination of technical, environmental, and socio-economic data enables a holistic approach to renewable energy planning that maximizes benefits while minimizing negative impacts.The document discusses the application of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) within GIS as a structured method for evaluating competing factors in site selection. MCDA allows planners to assign weights to different criteria based on their importance, then use spatial overlay techniques to rank potential sites. For example, in selecting a location for a wind farm, high wind speed might be given the greatest weight, followed by proximity to the grid, low environmental impact, and suitable land ownership conditions. The weighted layers are combined to produce a suitability map that highlights the best locations. This method ensures that decisions are transparent, replicable, and based on quantifiable data rather than subjective judgment alone.The authors also address challenges in geospatial renewable energy planning, including data availability, quality, and compatibility. In many regions, high-resolution meteorological, environmental, or infrastructure data may be limited or proprietary, making analysis more difficult. Data standardization is essential so that different datasets can be integrated effectively. Additionally, while GIS and remote sensing provide powerful tools, they require technical expertise, software resources, and computing capacity, which may not be available in all countries or institutions. The paper notes that capacity building and training are important to enable more widespread use of these technologies in developing regions where renewable energy expansion is most urgently needed.The document gives case studies where geospatial analysis has been successfully applied. One example is in identifying optimal sites for solar farms in India, where GIS was used to map solar irradiance, land use, slope, and proximity to the power grid, resulting in clear recommendations for high-priority development zones. Another case study from Europe showed how wind energy planners used GIS to avoid bird migration routes and sensitive ecosystems while still capturing strong wind resources. In Africa, GIS-based hydrological modeling has been used to identify small hydroelectric opportunities for rural electrification. These real-world applications demonstrate how geospatial tools provide both environmental protection and economic efficiency in renewable energy development.Finally, the paper argues that as renewable energy technology becomes more advanced and widely adopted, the role of geospatial analysis will become even more central. The integration of real-time data from IoT devices, drones, and smart grids with GIS platforms will allow dynamic energy planning that can adapt to changing conditions. For example, predictive models could use weather forecasts and real-time energy demand data to adjust the operation of solar and wind farms, ensuring optimal performance and grid stability. As climate change accelerates and the urgency of decarbonization increases, the combination of geospatial intelligence and renewable energy planning will be a cornerstone of sustainable development strategies worldwide. The authors conclude that while technology provides the tools, successful implementation requires political will, public engagement, and interdisciplinary collaboration among engineers, environmental scientists, economists, and policymakers. By embracing geospatial approaches, governments and developers can ensure that renewable energy projects are not only technically and economically viable but also socially equitable and environmentally responsible, paving the way for a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

In such an environment, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare staff have to constantly deal with multiple challenges such as patients who are unable to communicate, the need to quickly move between different rooms for treatments or diagnostic tests, high stress levels for both staff and patients, and the constant flow of new patients requiring immediate attention. Unlike many other healthcare settings, the workflow in the ED is often unpredictable because patients’ arrival and treatment do not always follow a fixed order. Activities like patient registration, triage, bed assignment, medical evaluation, and treatment can happen in overlapping or changing sequences depending on urgency. This unpredictable and high-pressure situation is made worse by three major, well-known problems common to EDs worldwide: overcrowding, backlogs of pending tasks, and patients leaving without proper discharge (often called “absconded patients”). Overcrowding occurs when the number of patients needing emergency services exceeds the ability of staff to provide timely and quality care. Backlogs happen when the accumulation of work outpaces staff capacity. Absconded patients are those who leave without informing the staff, potentially without receiving needed treatment. These problems are interrelated overcrowding leads to delays, delays create backlogs, and the combination of both can increase the risk of patients leaving prematurely. Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz (HCTM), a teaching hospital under Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), faces these same issues. Although it is a semi-public hospital with slightly higher fees than fully public hospitals, its ED still receives a high volume of patients, averaging around 72,000 visits annually in earlier years. Upon arrival, patients are categorized into critical, semi-critical, and non-critical zones. Non-critical cases are the most frequent, often double the number of semi-critical cases, which means that even a temporary surge in non-critical arrivals can disrupt the flow of semi-critical and critical patients, leading to delays and overcrowding. Studies in other Malaysian hospitals have shown that higher overcrowding correlates with higher rates of absconded patients, although HCTM has had somewhat lower rates thanks to certain dedicated staff roles, shorter waiting times for some cases, and slightly higher fees that may deter walkouts. Nonetheless, patient satisfaction remains a key measure of ED performance, and surveys have indicated that only about 75% of ED patients at HCTM were satisfied with services.To address these issues and improve satisfaction, the research team developed a patient tracking system (PTS) tailored to the ED environment. The idea was inspired by similar systems in nursing homes and made possible by advances in wireless networking, wearable sensors, and cloud-based data storage. A PTS can track both the location of patients and their vital signs in real time, triggering alerts when needed. Some hospitals have experimented with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and other location technologies, which have improved patient flow and reduced delays. However, RFID has some drawbacks it consumes more energy, can experience reader collisions, and may not be ideal for shorter-range, precise indoor tracking. The researchers decided to use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon technology instead. Beacons can be used to determine a person’s position indoors by picking up signals from multiple points, offering greater security, lower energy consumption, and better performance for short-range applications.The system developed for this study was named TrackMe©, a mobile application available on Android, designed for two types of users: medical staff (primarily nurses and doctors) and patients’ next of kin. Patients in the ED were given a Bluetooth beacon wristband, which would transmit signals picked up by strategically placed beacon gateways throughout the department, including the yellow zone, observation ward, minor operating theatre, X-ray area, and CT scan area. When a patient passed near one of these gateways, their location was automatically updated in the system via BLE. This location data, along with the patient’s current medical status as entered by staff, would be visible in the TrackMe© app.For medical staff, the TrackMe© app allowed them to view the current location and medical status of all patients, access detailed patient information, update patient status, and send messages to the patient’s next of kin. Medical status options included “In Treatment,” “Discharge–Stay in Ward,” and “Discharge–Return Home.” Messaging worked in real-time with push notifications to ensure timely communication. For patients’ next of kin, the app was simpler, allowing them to see the patient’s location and status and to send messages to staff. This meant that relatives could wait in other, more comfortable areas of the hospital (such as the cafeteria or lobby) while still staying informed, reducing crowding and noise in the ED waiting area. The messaging function also reduced the need for public announcements over the PA system, which could be disruptive and stressful.A user satisfaction study was conducted at HCTM’s ED with 60 participants: 30 nurses (representing medical staff) and 30 patients’ next of kin. Participants were asked to use the TrackMe© system and then complete a questionnaire based on a Likert scale (1 to 5, from strong disagreement to strong agreement) measuring aspects such as usefulness, ease of use, satisfaction, and design. Demographic data showed that most nurses were between 21 and 40 years old, while next of kin had a wider age range, with many over 40. Before using the system, 90% of all participants reported previous difficulty in tracking patient location, and 83% had difficulty getting patient status information in the ED.Results were very positive overall. Both groups gave average scores above 4 out of 5 for most usability and satisfaction measures. Nurses rated the system slightly higher for usefulness (average 4.1) than next of kin (average 4.0), while next of kin rated design and ease of use slightly higher. All reliability measures (Cronbach’s alpha) were above 0.93, indicating consistent responses. Open-ended feedback revealed that nurses valued the system for making patient monitoring easier, being user-friendly, and improving access to location data. Next of kin appreciated its ease of use, usefulness for locating patients, prevention of missing patients, and its role in reducing overcrowding at the nurse’s counter.There were some negative comments. Nurses mentioned lack of time to update patient status, a desire for more two-way communication features, and concerns about losing beacon devices. Next of kin noted that the app currently only worked in the ED, that they were sometimes unaware it was available, and that some were unfamiliar with its functions. Despite these issues, 100% of next of kin participants said they would recommend TrackMe© for future use and wanted it expanded beyond the ED. Nurses acknowledged its benefits but were less enthusiastic about expansion because of the extra workload it created. (ROSMINA JAAFAR1, 2022)											Rosmina Jafari											20222.
